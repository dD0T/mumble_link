mumble_link is a minimal python module intended for exercising
Mumble's link positional audio plugin from python.

Without a native module this wouldn't be easily possible as
the link plugin is based on a shared memory structure and
is available on Linux as well as on Windows.

The module depends on boost python as well as boost thread.

Here is how you could use mumble_link:
>>> import mumble_link
>>> mumble_link.setup("myplugin", "myplugin is a just a test")
>>> mumble_link.set_context("Some\0Crazy\0Context")
>>> mumble_link.set_identity("Not sure")
>>> mumble_link.set_avatar_pos(1,2,3)
...
